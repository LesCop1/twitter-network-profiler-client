## TNP - Twitter Network Profiler
Twitter Network Profiler is a web app allowing you to see the relations around your target's Twitter account. It allows you, to see up to relations of depth 3, therefore a more global view around your target and learn more information about them. You have a lot of information on each found account, even their Instagram if available. 

## The Client
This repository is only the client which is the web application. The web app can't work without the server so you will have to install and run the TNP Server too.

## Configuration
